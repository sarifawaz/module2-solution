        <h2 id="pan">Pan-frying</h2>
        <p>To pan-fry chicken breasts, heat a frying pan on medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and allow to heat through. Place the chicken breast in the pan and allow to cook for 7 or 8 minutes or until brown and golden.
            Turn over and repeat until chicken breast is cooked.

        <h2 id="bbq">Grilling/BBQ</h2>
        <p>
            If you would like to char-grill or barbeque chicken, choose chicken breasts, tenderloins or thigh fillets. If you are using a flattened chicken, 
            you can char-grill both sides for colour and flavour and then place in the oven to cook through thoroughly with moderate heat.

    <section id="box3">
        <h2 id="baking">Baking/roasting</h2>
        <p>For baking, Wings, chicken thigh cutlets and whole chickens are best. As these cuts have a bone in the centre, it takes these cuts longer to cook all the way through. By baking,
             the drumstick will be cooked by an even heat all over, while gently cooking the skin at the same time.
